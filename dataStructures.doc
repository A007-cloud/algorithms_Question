Q1. Count Factors - 2


Problem Description
Given an integer A, you need to find the count of it's factors.

Factor of a number is the number which divides it perfectly leaving no remainder.

Example : 1, 2, 3, 6 are factors of 6


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109


Input Format
First and only argument is an integer A.


Output Format
Return the count of factors of A.


Example Input
Input 1:
5
Input 2:
10


Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Factors of 5 are 1 and 5.
Explanation 2:
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.



Q2. IsPrime

Problem Description
Given a number A. Return 1 if A is prime and return 0 if not. 

Note : 
The value of A can cross the range of Integer.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109


Input Format
The first argument is a single integer A.


Output Format
Return 1 if A is prime else return 0.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 5
Input 2:

A = 10


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
5 is a prime number.
Explanation 2:

10 is not a prime number.


Q3. Find Perfect Numbers


Problem Description
You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106



Input Format
First and only argument contains a single positive integer A.



Output Format
Return 1 if A is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 4
Input 2:

A = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

0 
Output 2:

1 


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
Explanation 2:

For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6. 



Q4. Count of primes

Problem Description
You will be given an integer n. You need to return the count of prime numbers less than or equal to n.


Problem Constraints
0 <= n <= 10^3


Input Format
Single input parameter n in function.


Output Format
Return the count of prime numbers less than or equal to n.


Example Input
Input 1:
19
Input 2:
1


Example Output
Output 1:
8
Output 2:
0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Primes <= 19 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
Explanation 2:
There are no primes <= 1
